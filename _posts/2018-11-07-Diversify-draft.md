People want to be a part of something. It is a survivalist motive. And it is natural and important for human fulfillment. Being a part of something does not make us less individual. Individualism is great, and equally important as collectivism.

There are certain tasks all of us must do autonomous, without consent of our superior. Why is that? Because we cannot ask all the questions all the time. Some tasks are a matter company culture, and the others are a professional must.

Maybe we are talking about more basic problems, such as whether or not you should write documentation in this manner or another. We should probably ask the first time, and later do it in same manner without asking, as it may provide more breaks and pauses in the creation process.

And if we go to the harder questions, let's say you are a developer who is not sure whether or not to write tests. You know it will take 5% more of your time to write basic tests while writing code, and that tests may later save 50% of manual testing time. (Or is it 99% for some cases.) It is not just the time of QA department that we are talking about. Most often, it may be a great portion of the developer's time, either to locate errors, or(/AND) to solve them. You SHOULD write them. A quicly fabricated agile/scrum master may tell "don't spend time on that, we need POC ASAP!", but he/she cannot be explained that it really is a 5% of time less spent on POC, and that it will save bunch of time later. And not to talk about time it may save even during POC development phase, when some errors may be detected on the early stage.

So, autonomy is important. But how do we become autonomous? I think there are a lot of factors that make us less autonomous. There are people who have family - so they are scared to try anything that is outside of project managers scope, even though that may benefit the project. Those may be the people that are even to scared to ASK. Asking is good. Try asking. If you come to the blockade, you may stop asking. But if you don't even ask, you will never know if there was a chance for your idea to go through. If the idea was good, it is a company's failure not to take it into consideration. And us, being a part of the company, also lose in this situation.

There are people from other proffesions, that thought it was a better idea to try themselves in IT. They may be scared for the endevours because of there background, finding comfort zone in "hiding". Not asking, not doing anything autonomously, approving everything the superiour says (only because he/she is superior). It is natural, but it is not good. Not good for community, not good for colleagues, AND NOT GOOD FOR THE PRODUCT! Thus courage is something worth building. Companies must invest in team's and individual's courage. They are often affraid of it, because it may result in indiciduals becoming brave enough to leave the company. That is the problem. Is the company really that bad that people would leave it only if they had more bravery? Well, that would mean the company is really bad. And that people SHOULD leave it. But, I think (based on personal experience and LISTENING TO OTHER PEOPLES EXPERIENCES), that everyone should go through few phases before leaving the company. Most often, that procedures happens naturaly.

1) Saying what you do not agree with. It is a hard choice. Working with someone for some time (few months or several years), in full cooperation mode, and then, all of the sudden, questioning the methods? Yup. Once, we must start. Healthy conversation is a must. Really, most often did I find out I was not right. If I had not asked the hard questions, I would have (let's say 80% of times) not get the answers to what bores my mind. And that bad seed would grow inside, until the point when I would burst. Just to find out my burst was not based on reallity, but rather my comprehansion of it, and wrong direction that it had grown into.

2) If superiors, or collegues still don't agree with us, we may hear the right arguments, and change our mind (as in point 1). The other option is that we still do not agree with "them". I ask myself: "Am I unhappy?", "Don't I see the sense in this work, or with these people?", "Doesn't my superior respect me, although I respect him/her and do my job as agreed?"

3) The negative answer from the previous point should imply that it is a time for change. If it is not us that should change, and if other people do not want to change... You must evolve to the next level. Change the company. Oh, yes, you can do it.

I want through this list few times (in my proffesional life), and only after that could I write it down as a formula. I've changed places. Most often, other stayed, and it was easier for them at first. But I've gone to better companies, better communities, better bosses. At some point I've reached a fair boss, proffessional incubator, and a decent pay. It was defenitely worth all of the struggle.

When Sebastion and I started the Chaos Taxi, we though "Yo, this must not be a nightmare, but a dream". We wanted to start a company with a healthy culture, that would upgrade their empoyees. We did not to go too quick into success, but rahter make something that, if it fails, we would not say it was a bad idea (in matter of spent time). We would have said it was a time well spent... Luckily, we will not know for sure what we would have said, as our project, set on the right foundations, with right people, gave us more than we expected.

People are the key. Respect them. They are not resources. They, of course, are that, in a metaphoric, or materialistic sense. But (believe it or not) they are beeings. They have emotions ans stuff. And, luckily, we live in a periond of history, where we can afford luxury, such as free time, happiness, and peace. No one carried their job home, or no one had skipped lunch because of a bug or something. It is not a good strategy. It seems as a "victory" at first, but having that kind of company culture, makes worse results on the long run. I don't have to say - there are also people too kind to be leaders. It is not the point of this paragraph, to bee naive. The point is to be humane. The point is not to lie your employees that you are an agile guru just because you know the words "sprint", "milestone" and sadly "pivot". Following Agile because of it's popularity - not cool. Let's say it is normal (people analyzing other people's experiences, and realizing it must be good because everyone use it), then - people should use it properly. Agile is a discipline. It is a science. A methodology. It may not be treated as less. It cannot be done in fragments. Learn - implement - test - learn... And so on. But learn!
