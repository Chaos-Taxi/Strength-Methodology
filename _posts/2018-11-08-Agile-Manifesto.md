Fast to the point of this post. Quotes from [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) will be given in

>this kind of text block

## The Manifesto

and our comments will be given in regular indent like this. Let's go.

>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
>through early and continuous delivery
>of valuable software.

We think that it is a great idea. Sadly, customer is not always sure what does he want, or wants many things and cannot prioritize them. If we put that aside - the rule does prove it's value to the success of the product! But these two exceptions should not be neglected, as they may prove fatal! And they are not such a exceptions (if we take their frequency into account)!

>Welcome changing requirements, even late in 
>development. Agile processes harness change for 
>the customer's competitive advantage.

This is great. But constant pivoting and pressure on the development team makes the product sturdy. Coding fast with lots of project redirections, makes the product of low quality code, so changes to it become harder.

>Deliver working software frequently, from a 
>couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a 
>preference to the shorter timescale.

I have only good experience with this one. It gives possibilities for early traction-testing-learning-improving feedback.

>Business people and developers must work 
>together daily throughout the project.

Ok, maybe not daily, but also - thumbs up.

>Build projects around motivated individuals. 
>Give them the environment and support they need, 
>and trust them to get the job done.

This is where most so-called agilists fail to act by Agile manifesto. They often lack respect to the individuals who are, if not experts, then still better proffesionals considering their fild of expertize, than the "agile" project manager. That makes the manager involve too much in other peoples work, which breaks the important machine gears, one by one. Making further machine agility and reilability for change lower. Which is counter agile.

>The most efficient and effective method of 
>conveying information to and within a development 
>team is face-to-face conversation.

Well, we cannot say anything against this one. In contrary, hooray for it!

>Working software is the primary measure of progress.

Yes. The problem is that many so-called agilists also don't respect this clause.

>Agile processes promote sustainable development. 
>The sponsors, developers, and users should be able 
>to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

Hard ti achieve, but of course - great guideline.

>Continuous attention to technical excellence 
>and good design enhances agility.

Again, saidly, so-called agile project managers often forget about this one, thus making serious fatal consequences.

>Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount 
>of work not done--is essential.

Hail, simplicity!

>The best architectures, requirements, and designs 
>emerge from self-organizing teams.

Ave!

>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how 
>to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts 
>its behavior accordingly.

Amen!
